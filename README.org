* Overview
Simple package to capture a screenshot from a org buffer and insert it.
Works out of the box with Sway-wm (Wayland) and Windows 10.

* Support for other Linux distro
I built this function for my own niche need. If you are in the same situation as
me, Windows at work, Sway at home, then I hope it helps you.
